#the algorithm for the c_i's will be different for each boundary condition
#get the eqn that is: c_i terms = a_i terms
#the LHS forms a coeficiant matrix w/ the coeficiants of the c_i's
#the RHS form a colum vector since, this gives a solvable system of eqn's
#solve this w/ tridiagonal solution algorithm
#use the c_i values to solve for the b_i's and d_i's
